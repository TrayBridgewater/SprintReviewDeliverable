How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
  User needs are the cornerstone of why we're doing what we're doing - they should provide our work as developers and engineers with a sense of direction and purpose. 
  User stories are essential in this process because they contextualize and personify user needs. 
  
How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
  Developing programs should be done in an interative, incremental fashion. The time-blocking aspect of agile is an extremely good principle to apply to essentially any productive
   task, but especially computer programming. 

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
  Being a good team member in software development is a complicated task, but the most important part is being able to communicate openly and freely. 
  Expectations need to be set, but they also need to be communicated - what is an expectation worth if its one-sided?
